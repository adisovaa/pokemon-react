- Approximately 6 hours were spent on this task. 

- To make it convenient, I uploaded the project to the Heroku.

- Everything seems to work. 

- I used firebase for the backend. 

- For the frontend I used React, since I worked with it and it is convenient for me. 

- Thanks again for the time you spent sharing your knowledge of the company with me. 

- I will wait for your feedback.
